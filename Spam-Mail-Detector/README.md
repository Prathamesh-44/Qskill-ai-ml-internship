# Spam Mail Detector

## Objective
The objective of this project is to classify messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using machine learning and basic Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Dataset
- SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI Repository)
- Messages labeled as Spam or Ham

## Algorithm Used
- Naive Bayes Classifier

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the SMS spam dataset
2. Cleaned and preprocessed text data
3. Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Naive Bayes classifier
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy score

## Evaluation Metric
- Accuracy Score

## Result
The model successfully classifies spam and non-spam messages with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning and NLP techniques can be applied to text classification problems such as spam detection.
