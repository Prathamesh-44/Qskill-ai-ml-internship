# Iris Flower Classification

## 📌 Objective
To classify iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the **Iris dataset**, which is a standard dataset available in the **scikit-learn library** and originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

### Target Classes:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
2. Visualized the dataset using scatter plots.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

## 📊 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **97% to 100%** on the test dataset.

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
