# Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The classification is based on four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Dataset
- Iris Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository / scikit-learn)
- Total samples: 150
- Features: 4 numeric attributes
- Classes: 3 flower species

## Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset
2. Explored and understood the data
3. Visualized data using scatter plots
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained the KNN classification model
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Result
The model achieved approximately **96% accuracy**, showing effective classification of iris flower species.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning classification problem using a clean and well-known dataset. The KNN algorithm performed efficiently and provided high accuracy, making it suitable for beginners learning supervised machine learning.
